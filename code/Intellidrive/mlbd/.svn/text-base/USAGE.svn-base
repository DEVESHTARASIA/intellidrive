NOTE: Most of these commands must be run as the superuser.

BUILD:

Build using the included make file using the following command:

$ make


INSTALL MODULE:

After the build is complete the file mlbd.ko will be created.  Install the module using the following command:

$ insmod ./mlbd.ko

This will create the device /dev/mlbd0


USING THE BLOCK DEVICE:

In order to mount the block device it must first be formatted with a filesystem.  This can be done using the following command:

$ mke2fs -m 0 /dev/mlbd0

The device can then be mounted into the filesystem:

$ mkdir ./mlbd   # Can be any existing directory
$ mount /dev/mlbd0 ./mlbd

Any files created in the ./mlbd directory will be stored on the block device.  The block device can be unmounted from ./mlbd using the following command:

$ umount ./mlbd


REMOVE MODULE:

Before the block device can be removed it must be unmounted from the filesystem.  Once the device is unmounted the module can be removed using the following command:

$ rmmod mlbd
